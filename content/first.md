Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal blog, where I talk about AI, physics, chemistry, and whatever else Iâ€™m messing around with. Sometimes itâ€™s computational modeling, sometimes itâ€™s materials science, and sometimes itâ€™s just me pretending to be a business guy.

Expect insights, experiments, and the occasional unhinged deep dive. Feel free to stick around or reach outâ€”always happy to chat!

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
