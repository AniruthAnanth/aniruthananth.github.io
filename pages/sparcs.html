<h2>What is SPARCS?</h2>
<p>
    SPARCS, or Spectral Processing and Analysis for Recognition of Chemical Species, is a research project that I'm currently working.
    The goal of the project is to develop a system that can identify (and possibly quantify) chemical compounds in a sample using Raman spectroscopy data.

    <br><br>

    Raman spectroscopy is a non-destructive analytical technique that uses the interaction between light and a sample
    to create a "chemical fingerprint" of the sample from the vibrational energy levels. When light hits a sample,
    most of the light is scattered at the same wavelength (Rayleigh scattering), but a small fraction of the light is scattered
    at a different frequency due to an energy exchange with the vibrational modes of the sample. This is called the Raman effect.
    The Raman spectrum is a plot of the intensity of the scattered light as a function of the frequency shift from the incident light, 
    and it provides information about the bonds and functional groups in the sample.

    The end goal of SPARCS is an easy-to-use, portable device that can be used by non-experts to identify chemical compounds in a sample.

    The current goal of the project is to interpret spectral data with machine-learning techniques to identify and approximate chemical concentrations of unknown samples. 
    Our current approach to do this uses a lightweight neural network trained on an effective representation of gaseous components constructed from simulated reference data,
    and we hope to validate our results on experimental data soon.
    We anticipate that real-time analysis of unknown chemical compounds using this technique will enable remote, 
    non-invasive metabolic analysis, as well as passive hazardous leak detection and environmental monitoring.

<h2>SPARCS Progress Update 12/24/2024</h2>
Storing and loading from .json files finally became too tedious, so I decided to switch to a Jupyter notebook.
I ended up running it through Windows Subsystem Linux, which caused some interesting, but unrelated, bugs.
<br><br>
I also noticed that my simulated Raman spectra were not being generated correctly, so I had to go back and fix the way that I was generating them.
I ended up scrapping my initial code but retained the same underlying logic. 

In order to avoid recalculating the same spectra again and again, I calculated the reference spectra at the start of the program rather than recalculating them every time I needed them.
This made the program run much faster, but it also made the program take up a lot more memory. I'm not sure if this is a good trade-off, but I'll have to test it out more to see if it's worth it with a larger amount of chemicals and wavenumbers.
<br><br>
My plan was for the code to look something like this:
<pre class="code">function generate_compound_spectrum(peak_positions, peak_intensities, wavenumbers, peak_width)
    # Use the Gaussian function to generate the spectrum of a compound
end

# Precompute reference spectra for each compound
reference_spectra = {}

for compound, compound_data in compound_library
    reference_spectrum = generate_compound_spectrum(
        compound_data.peak_positions,
        compound_data.peak_intensities,
        wavenumbers,
        peak_width
    )

    reference_spectra[compound] = reference_spectrum
end

function generate_mixture_spectrum(compounds, concentrations, reference_spectra, noise_level=0.03)
    # Generate reasonable concentrations and combine the reference spectra to create a mixture spectrum
end</pre>
The coding part was pretty easy, but the generate_mixture_spectrum function had a lot of bugs that I had to fix. 
I ended up having to rewrite the function a few times before I got it to work correctly.
The primary issue was with the way I was calculating concentrations. Due the way I was randomly generating the concentration,
there was a clear average value for the concentration of each compound. After 10-20 epochs the neural network figured this out and
kept getting stuck at the average value. I had to change the way I was generating the concentrations to fix this issue.
<br><br>
I fixed this by randomly dropping some spectra from the mixture by setting their concentration to zero based on another random function.
The randomness compounded on itself, and it ended up forcing the neural network to actually try to estimate the concentration instead of just guessing the average.
<br><br>
Here's what the results ended up looking like based on 30000 mixtures generated from 15 reference spectra:

<pre class="code">Test MSE: 0.0049, Test MAE: 0.0511</pre>
